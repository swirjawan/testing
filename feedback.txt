1/ As this will be submitted as a reading deck, we ask you to elaborate your ideas as much as possible in text. You can supplement your ideas with examples. 
2/ Your definition is good and unique, great job! 
3/ Your current and desired state in slide 4 should be more descriptive. For example, it is unclear if ‚ÄúCombination of hybrid, agile and waterfall methodologies‚Äù 
   is positive or negative. We suggest you expand on your ideas so your messages come through clearer.
4/ The problem statement needs to be reworked so that it is relevant to your solutions. 
5/ You‚Äôve clearly identified the challenge, but your solutions need to be further developed. At the moment it is too broad and vague, we suggest you focus on 
   developing the ‚ÄòGuidelines‚Äô in depth to increase engagement while retaining the current work arrangement (3 days WFO + 2 days WFH). Consider the types of support 
   employees at Prudential will need, the benefits of your solutions, how it can be operationalised and how you can measure its success. While we constantly challenge 
   you to think BIG, you can always start small (like a pilot in your own teams), before rolling it out on larger scales across departments and the organisation. 
   Remember, these solutions should be something that you will champion as leaders at Prudential!
6/ As you consider how Prudential can support your initiative, we suggest you be specific in your asks.
7/ Overall, the flow is good, the presentation was easy to follow and understand. Well done! üòä
